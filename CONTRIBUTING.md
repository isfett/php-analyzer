# How to contribute

Thanks for considering to contribute to `php-analyzer`. While doing so please follow these guidelines:
 
 - You must follow the `isfett-coding-standard` ([link](https://www.github.com/isfett/coding-standard)). Add the phpcs and phpmd settings to your ide. If you use PhpStorm import the inspections.xml also.
 - All non trivial features or bugfixes must have an associated issue for discussion. If you want to work on an issue that is already created, please leave a comment on it indicating that you are working on it.
 - Add tests for features or bugfixes touching `src` code if you want to increase the chance of your contribution being merged.
 - You must use [feature / topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) to ease the merge of your contribution.
